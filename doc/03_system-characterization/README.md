# Finding the Natural Response of a Thermal System using Python's Scientific Toolbox

## Introduction
I'm a big fan of the [Embedded.FM](http://embedded.fm/) podcast and recently listened to Chris and Elecia White interview a guy named Matt Berggren. It was a great interview but at one point, Matt says something to the effect of "school taught me matricies and differential equations which I haven't used since..."

I see this sort of sentiment all over the place. For the most part, unless you are in academia or very cutting edge R&D, the really technical aspects of engineering can be simplified to rules of thumb and abstracted away. A good engineer will design to 80%, not fiddle with minutiae, and iterate until the design hits the desired spec. This article is not necesarily about quickly solving an engineering problem but peeling away the layers for a fuller understanding of the world you're trying to design in.

This article is a side note of the oven controller project I am developing in my other tutorials. Using a simple Python script to control the oven power and log the temperature data, we can create a file to analyze certain aspects of the oven, namely the natural response. This article is here to fill in some gaps between the theory behind the project and the implementation using a microcontroller. It's not all about circuits, but it's still pretty dang interesting.

## What You Need

### Hardware
* Oven controller and TRIAC dimmer from previous tutorials
* Laptop to run test outdoors
* K-Type thermocouple and MAX31855 to measure temperature
* USB-to-Serial converter like FTDI FT232RL

### Software
* Python 3
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * SciPy
  * PySerial
* Script files (attached below)
  * Data logger script
  * Data processing script

## Warning
As a word of caution, this test may involve some pretty noxious fumes so be careful about where you run your test and which thermocouple probe you use. I purchased a $10 probe from DigiKey that was rated only to about 200C. That rating corresponds more to the plastic insulation than to the metal filament itself â€“ the MAX31855 can measure up to thousands of degrees given the right probe. I had to run the test outside because the oven got up to 400C and started melting the high-temperature thermoplastic. The test ran fine but it produced some really nasty fumes and a really ugly thermocouple probe. Do your best to not breathe the fumes in. Also, be cautious of fires, burning yourself / property, and pets that may wander by not knowing any better.


## The Natural Response

The natural response of a system (in our case a toaster oven) is the system's response to initial conditions with all external forces set to zero. What we would like to get out of the natural response test is an equation that estimates the behavior of the system with enough accuracy to design around.

A thermal system can be [modeled as a first order differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_constant#Thermal_time_constant), much like an RC circuit:

```TeX
\frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{1}{\tau}T = \frac{1}{\tau}T_{a}
```
where
```TeX
\tau  =  \frac{\rho c_p V}{hA_s}
``` 

Expanding further, *T* is the temperature, *A_s* is the surface area, *rho* is the density, *c_p* is the specific heat, *T_a* is the constant ambient temperature, and *V* is the body volume.

If we turn the oven on full blast and let it reach an equilibrium temperature, when we remove power and measure the temp as it cools, it's known from [Newton's Law of Cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling) that the solution to this differential equation will take the form:

```TeX
T(t)= T_0\cdot e^{-t/\tau} + T_{a}
```

*T_0* is the temperature above ambient, *tau* is the thermal time constant, and *T_a* is again the ambient temperature.

*tau*, being the thermal time constant, also corresponds to "the time required for \[the oven\] to change 63.2% of the total difference between its initial and final body temperature when subjected to a step function change in temperature, under zero power conditions". [U.S. Sensor Whitepaper](https://www.digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/USSensor_615/PDF/USsensor_Thermal_Time_Constant.pdf?redirected=1) This is a quantity that can be measured from the collected data.

Now that we have an equation, we can use Python to automate the collection of temperature data and then smack it around using the SciPy optimization toolbox to get the values that fill up the equation.

## The Software

There are three "moving parts" to this:
* A working oven controller that can interpret UART commands
  * This has been covered in previous tutorials and only relevant source files to the natural response test will be provided. 
* A script that can control the oven power though the UART and measure the temperature for data logging
  * This is a fast and dirty script that just sets the oven to full power and logs the temp until you tell it to stop
* A script to post-process the data and fit a curve to the sampled temperature values
  * This digs into the Python scientific toolbox for plotting and such


### ATMega328P UART Command Interface

The oven's microcontroller code can be seen below. It's a modified version of Colin N. Brosseau's code which parses UART commands and runs predefined functions based on the input.

```

This code reads data from the UART buffer and parses out commands and value assignments. The `cmd_processCommand(*max31855 tempSense)` section shows which commands are set up. A command with a 'g' is a 'get info' statement and doesn't require an argument; a command with an 's' is a 'set value' command and requires that you have a '=' character and an integer value following it. For example, to set the oven power to 75%, you would send: `sp=75`.

### Python Oven Interface and Data Logger

The next step is to write a Python script that can read and write to the UART using the PySerial library. The automated script assumes `/dev/ttyUSB0` is the serial port to interact with and cam be modified for your particular device.

```Python
import time
import sys
import serial
import csv
from datetime import datetime

def countdown(t):
    while t:
        mins, secs = divmod(t, 60)
        timeformat = '{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(mins, secs)
        print(timeformat, end='\r')
        time.sleep(1)
        t -= 1

# Set up the port
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600, timeout = 1)

oven_on = ("sp=100\r\n").encode('ascii')
oven_off = ("sp=0\r\n").encode('ascii')
get_tctemp = ("gte\r\n").encode('ascii')

ser.write(oven_off)

print('Measure step response of toaster')
print('Please ensure toaster is at ambient temp.')
print('Press ENTER to begin and <CTRL>+C to end.')
input('>>> ')

csv_file = open('stepresponse.csv', 'w', newline='')
writer = csv.writer(csv_file)

# Read some temps
print('Starting in')
countdown(5)

# Write some stuff to the oven
ser.write(oven_on)

try:
    while(True):
        ser.write(get_tctemp)
        tc_temp = (ser.readline()).decode('ascii')
        tc_temp = tc_temp.rstrip()
        
        print(tc_temp)
        writer.writerow([datetime.now(), tc_temp])
        
        time.sleep(0.01)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Interrupted. Closing CSV.")
    csv_file.close()
    ser.write(oven_off)
```

This script opens the `/dev/ttyUSB0` serial port, waits for the user to hit ENTER, counts down, and then turns the oven on full. There's a while loop in place that continuously reads the temperature, gives it a timestamp, and writes it all to a CSV file. When you decide to finish the test, hit CTRL+C to cancel and close the CSV file.

### Python Curve Fitting

The following is the meat an potatoes of the tutorial, and is the most project agnostic. It uses NumPy vectors to work with the numerical data, Matplotlib's PyPlot to display the data, and the SciPy optimization toolbox to fit a curve to the sampled data we got from the test.

```Python
import csv
import sys
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the exponential function we want to fit a curve to
def exponential(x, a, b, c):
    return a * np.exp(-b * x) + c

# Open CSV file in read+binary mode
#f = open(sys.argv[1], newline='')
f = open('natural-response.csv', newline='')

# Lists for CSV Datas
timestamp = []  
tempdata = []

# Read the CSV file and convert the data back into more useful types
try:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        timestamp.append(datetime.strptime(row[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f'))
        tempdata.append(int(row[1]))
finally:
    f.close()

# Determine from timestamps an array t with elements 
# equal to the time after beginning test
t = []
for entry in timestamp:
    delta = entry - timestamp[0]
    t.append(delta.seconds + delta.microseconds / 1000000)

# Numbered list from 0 to however big the array is. This is not used but I
# figured it out while making this script and I think it's a cool expression
# x = [i for i in range(len(tempdata))]

# Determine thermal time constant. During cooldown, find time to go from
# max temp to 63% of max temp.
tc = t[next(i[0] for i in enumerate(tempdata) if i[1] < 236)]

# Numpy stop being dumb and just let me use t as an argument!
popt, pcov = curve_fit(exponential, np.array(t), tempdata, p0 = (400, 1/tc, 27))
guess = exponential(np.array(t), *popt)
print('System parameters\n-----------------')
print('Estimated thermal time constant: {0} seconds'.format(tc))
print('Optimized thermal time constant: {0} seconds'.format(1/popt[1]))

print('Optimized values:')
print('y(0) = {0}, 1/TC = {1}, c = {2}'.format(*popt))

# Put everything onto a plot
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, tempdata, 'b-', linewidth = 2, label="Original Sampled Data")
plt.plot(t, guess, 'r-', label="Fitted Curve")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

The actual curve fitting is done with `popt, pcov = curve_fit(exponential, np.array(t), tempdata, p0 = (400, 1/tc, 27))`. It requires a best guess of initial values and because we know the system is a first order exponential, has an initial value of 400 C, and has a measurable time constant, we can feed all that back into the function to get our result.

The script prints out the fitted equation and then plots the data as well as the estimated line.

## Conclusion
